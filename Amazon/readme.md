# [Question-2 Longest Mountain ](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-mountain-in-array/)
  
You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:

-> arr.length >= 3
-> There exists some index i (0-indexed) with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
    -> arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
    -> arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
Given an integer array arr, return the length of the longest subarray, which is a mountain. Return 0 if there is no mountain subarray.
