# [https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/total-decoding-messages1235/1/](Question-8 Total Decoding Messages)

A top secret message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
You are an FBI agent. You have to determine the total number of ways that message can be decoded, as the answer can be large return the answer modulo 109 + 7.

Note: An empty digit sequence is considered to have one decoding. It may be assumed that the input contains valid digits from 0 to 9 and If there are leading 0’s, extra trailing 0’s and two or more consecutive 0’s then it is an invalid string.
