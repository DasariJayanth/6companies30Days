# [uestion-6 Greatest Common Divisor of Strings](Qhttps://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-of-strings/)

For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + ... + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).
Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.

# [Question-7 Find the position of M-th item](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-the-position-of-m-th-item1723/1/)

M items are to be delivered in a circle of size N. Find the position where the M-th item will be delivered if we start from a given position K. Note that items are distributed at adjacent positions starting from K.

# [Question-8 Total Decoding Messages](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/total-decoding-messages1235/1/)

A top secret message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
You are an FBI agent. You have to determine the total number of ways that message can be decoded, as the answer can be large return the answer modulo 109 + 7.

Note: An empty digit sequence is considered to have one decoding. It may be assumed that the input contains valid digits from 0 to 9 and If there are leading 0’s, extra trailing 0’s and two or more consecutive 0’s then it is an invalid string.

# [Question-9 Number following a Pattern](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/number-following-a-pattern3126/1)

Given a pattern containing only I's and D's. I for increasing and D for decreasing.
Devise an algorithm to print the minimum number following that pattern. Digits from 1-9 and digits can't repeat.

# [Question-10 Max 10 Numbers in list with 10M entries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-to-find-n-largest-elements-from-a-list/?ref=lbp)
